# Current availability of the code
- show an interactive plot in html
    - check out `plotly_figure.html` created by `interactive_notebook.ipynb`

# Progress
- Figured out that `Plotly` figures cannot be observed when ipynb file was converted into HTML file. This is due to the mechanism of Plotly, which we cannot fix. For further details, check out Issue #1 in thie repo.
- Fixed issue in `interactive_notebook.ipynb`
    - Incorrect saving method resulted in broken html file
